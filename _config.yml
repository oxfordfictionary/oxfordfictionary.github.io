user_description: I'm a student at Lambda School with special interests in machine learning, neural style transfer, data analytics, and data engineering. Stay tuned for my projects.
background: >In college I discovered my love of inferential statistics and the human mind while getting my degrees in psychology and communication studies. 
>Now I aspire to contribute to the development of the non-human mind; specifically, I hope to promote technology that honors the agency of people and contribute to projects that enhance the current practice of ethics in the applications of machine learning and data science. 
>In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, listening to podcasts, and reading science fiction. The Three Body Problem triology by Liu Cixin is just about my favorite thing right now.
